future conflict?

This focus on high technology can
be found across academic research (Tangredi 2019; Johnson 2017), in the doctrinal
statements of western navies (MoD, 2018, 142–145; ADF, 2019, 8; Bekkers et al. 2019,

High technology weapons are associated with the emergence of nuclear weapons,
electronics and the “information revolution”, although the first two of which have their
origins in the Second World War (H

Moreover, in many cases “high technologies” are added to older weapon and thus their
overall impact is more evolutionary and incremental
