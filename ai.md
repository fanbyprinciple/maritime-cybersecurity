There
may be a considerable first-mover advantage to the country that first understands
AI adequately enough to change its existing human-centered force structures and
embrace AI warfighting

The principal
consequence of this is that AI will make it much easier to detect, localize and iden-
tity objects across the battlespace

 The ‘find’ starting point is plac-
ing a large number of low cost Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in the optimum
land, sea, air, space and cyber locations in the areas across which hostile forces
may transit. From these sensors, a deep understanding can be gained of the un-
dersea terrain, sea conditions, physical environment and local virtual milieu.

Uncrewed Vehicles (UV) could be deployed across
the battlespace equipped with a variety of electronic systems suitable for the
Counter Intelligence Surveillance And Reconnaissance And Targeting (C-ISRT)
task. The intent is to defeat the adversary’s AI ‘find’ capabilities

DARPA’s Ocean of Things (OoT) program aims to achieve maritime situational
awareness over large ocean areas through deploying thousands of small, low-cost
floats that form a distributed sensor network. Each smart float will have a suite of
commercially available sensors to collect environmental and activity data; the
later function involves automatically detecting, tracking and identifying nearby
ships and – potentially – close aircraft traffic

existing large
array of traditional maritime surveillance systems. The latest system into service
is the long-endurance MQ-4C Triton uncrewed aerial vehicle with detection capa-
bilities able to be enhanced through retrofitting AI.

through, stationary relocatable sensors like the USN’s Transformational Reliable
Acoustic Path System 

This might be done us-
ing some of the large array of AI-enabled floaters, gliders, autonomous devices,
underwater vehicles and uncrewed surface vessels to considerably confuse the dig-
ital ocean picture

Test and refine concepts through focused wargaming, model-
ing, and simulations� Validate these concepts through fleet exercises, unit
training, and certification
