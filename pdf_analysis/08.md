# Looking at the key highlights for maritime components

In the new era technology onboard ships should rise to to meet the challenge of OODA loops.

### Abstract BLUF

In this essay we will try and evaluate the effect of cyber security on ships operations through the framework of OODA loops (A decision cycle of Observe, orient, decide and act, pedagogy developed by COlonal John Boyd, USAF) 

### Introduction

About the ships and the threat of cyber

### Digital Seas

### Metaphorical cyber sea onboard the actual sea

### Requirement of technical surevey of cyber security analysis

### Framework of OODA Loop

    it is simply unrealistic to expect that the current requirements process will produce a 
    warship that will be combat effective for that long. This once might have worked, when cycle
    times for defense technology were measured in decades, but those timelines have compressed 
    drastically and can now be measured in years for hardware, and in months for software. 

### Key challenges to Cybersecurity onboard ships

1. Pace of technology

3. Knowledge gap - expertise

4. Implementation gap - processes

5. technology obsolesnce 

6. Cost to mordernise

7. Hardware doesn't change

### Key Enablers for Change

1. Agile tech aquisition

2. 

## Key aspects of running a ship

Direct FLeet Operator Engagement and input

## Shore to Shore communication

# The ooda loop

explanation

### What is an ooda loop

>Advantages and Drawbacks of OODA loop to be mentioned briefly

### cautions of the ooda loop

1. tempo variation
2. Large organisation paralysis

# Technology insertion in OODA loop

    Tailored inputs to the Observe stage include: 
    • Fleet Input (via TANG / Athena) 
    • Operational Requirements 
    • Technical Requirements 
    • Specifications and Standards 
    • Acquisition Lessons Learned 
    • Logistics Strategy 
    • Previous Deficiencies 
    • Threat/Intelligence 
    • Test and Evaluation strategies and results 
    • Operational and Technical Models 
    • Financials (including budget, execution, color of money aspects, and investment estimates) 
    • Economy (global and national considerations) 
    • Technology Solutions from industry, academia and government, including: 
    o Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) 
    o Military Off The Shelf (MOTS) 
    o Research and Development activities 
    o Science and Technology activities 

    The Orient stage is modified from the elements described by Boyd to those aligned with the 
    Navy ship acquisition domain and discussed earlier: 
    • Tactical Requirements Group (TRG) 
    • Technology Insertion Group (TIG) 
    • Digital Twin 
    • Program Management (PM) 
    • Systems Engineering (SE)

    The Decide stage is informed by System Evolution Roadmaps, Technology Roadmaps 
    and Acquisition Strategies from the Orientation stage, then feeds forward Experimentation Plans 
    for prototypes or Developmental Test Plans with mature/maturing systems to be executed in the 

    Act stage.
    The Act stage is where experimentation or various developmental tests, verifications 
    and evaluation of products, product elements, or manufacturing or support processes is 
    conducted (Defense Acquisition University (DAU), 2018). These are done throughout the 
    acquisition process to assist in engineering design and development and to verify that technical 
    performance specifications have been met
