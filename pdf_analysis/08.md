# Looking at the key highlights for maritime components

In the new era technology onboard ships should rise to to meet the challenge of OODA loops.

### Abstract BLUF

In this essay we will try and evaluate the effect of cyber security on ships operations through the framework of OODA loops (A decision cycle of Observe, orient, decide and act, pedagogy developed by COlonal John Boyd, USAF) 

### Introduction

About the ships and the threat of cyber

### Digital Seas

### Metaphorical cyber sea onboard the actual sea

### Requirement of technical surevey of cyber security analysis

### Framework of OODA Loop

    it is simply unrealistic to expect that the current requirements process will produce a 
    warship that will be combat effective for that long. This once might have worked, when cycle
    times for defense technology were measured in decades, but those timelines have compressed 
    drastically and can now be measured in years for hardware, and in months for software. 

### Key challenges to Cybersecurity onboard ships

1. Pace of technology

3. Knowledge gap - expertise

4. Implementation gap - processes

5. technology obsolesnce 

6. Cost to mordernise

7. Hardware doesn't change

### Key Enablers for Change

1. Agile tech aquisition

2.
