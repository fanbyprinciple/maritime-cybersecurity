Well-established
 regulations and guidelines have been implemented for decades on topics such as envi
ronmental and crew safety and, more recently, on ballast water management; these risks
 are tangible. However, cyber risks are different. Their intangible nature means that their
 consequences are not palpable; therefore, it is difficult for them to be initially identified
 and addressed. Infected applications, computers in the office, or operational technology
 (OT) systems on board may continue to operate without any noticeable performance issues.
 Unlike any other risk, when a cyber breach occurs, it can affect the entire infrastructure of
 an organization, including its fleet and offices around the world.

 It is not a farfetched scenario in which a critical cloud service
 provider or even a satellite communications services provider could be interrupted or
 ceased altogether because of a cyber breach. Such incidents could cascade on a global
 scale and impact all economic activities. The most profound example is the NotPetya
 malware attack in July 2017, which had a huge impact on global economic activities,
 costing approximately $892.5 million [5]. Research institutes and regulatory authorities are
 struggling to model, let alone quantify, cyber risk, mainly due to the lack of relevant data
