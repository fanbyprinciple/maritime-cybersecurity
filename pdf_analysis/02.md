UNderstanding human behavior as part of cybersecurity risk

cyber security can be de ned as the protection
 of cyberspace itself, the electronic information, the ICTs
 that support cyberspace, and the users of cyberspace in their
 personal, societal and national capacity, including any of their
 interests, either tangible or intangible, that are vulnerable
 144896
 to attacks originating in cyberspace

 Potential cyber-attacks towards theOT-andIT-systemscan
 be divided into two main groups: un-targeted cyber-attacks
 (when the attacker uses tools and techniques available on the
 internet to locate and exploit widespread vulnerabilities) and
 targeted cyber-attacks (when the attacker use sophisticated
 tools and techniques speci cally created for targeting a ship
ping company or a vessel)

 It is important to pay more
 attention to human behavior within maritime cyber security,
 and to understand how we can enable the humans operating
 in the maritime domain.
